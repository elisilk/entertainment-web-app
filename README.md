# Frontend Mentor - Entertainment web app solution

This is a solution to the [Entertainment web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic project.

I completed this challenge as part of the [JavaScript frameworks and libraries](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/javascript-frameworks-and-libraries-JDWoqQjMyb) Frontend Mentor learning path. This continues my efforts to learn my chosen JS Framework - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) + [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)

### What I learned

As always, so many cool :sunglasses: things. Here are some of the key resources I used:

- Vue
  - [Class and Style Bindings](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style)
- Pinia
  - [Defining a Store > Setup Stores](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/#Setup-Stores) - I tried for the first time the alternate syntax form for setting up Pinia Stores called the "Setup Stores" syntax. This syntax more closely mirrors the [Vue's Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq) (vs the [Options API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles)).- Vue Router
  - [Vue Examples - Computed with v-model](https://skirtles-code.github.io/vue-examples/patterns/computed-v-model)
  - [Active links](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/active-links)
  - [Passing Props to Route Components](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/passing-props.html)
- Working with images in Vue - This is still a bit mysterious and frustrating to me. I'm not 100% sure when it breaks and when it works.

- [`:focus-within`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within)

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- [ ] There is a lot of repeated code in the different views. Consolidate into one view that is sent props for different routes.

Specific enhancements I'd like to make (feature requests):

- [ ] ...

More general ideas I want to consider:

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

- [ ] Read and incorporate the Vue [Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/) into the application
- [ ] Finish watching and learning from Vue School's [Vue Router 4 for Everyone: Master Routing in Vue.js](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-router-4-for-everyone) course
- [ ] Improve my skills with Git
  - using git diff to see changes
  - combining multiple commits into a single push
